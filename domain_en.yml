          contract. The bank will seek legal enforcement through the court system.\n

          These charges will continue to accrue until the point of payment, in accordance with the terms specified in the 
          agreement you agreed upon. When you are compelled to settle the outstanding amount, you will be required to pay

  utter_credit_score:
  - text: "A Credit Scoring Model is a risk management tool that evaluates a loan applicant's creditworthiness by 
          predicting the likelihood of default using historical data. It employs numerical methods to rank cases, 
          condensing integrated data into a single value to gauge risk. This mathematical model estimates the probability 
          of default, indicating the chance of credit events such as bankruptcy, defaults, and non-payment by customers.
          In credit scoring, AI uses advanced algorithms to analyze a wide range of data, predict credit risk, and automate 
          the process. It considers factors like payment history, income, and more to assess an applicant's creditworthiness.
          AI improves efficiency, customization, and accuracy but must also address issues of bias and transparency in 
          decision-making. In the context of Michu loans, the application incorporates the Transaction Activity Using RFM 
          Model and the Business Growth Model to forecast company growth. Moreover, it employs the Performance & 
          Behavioral Model to evaluate potential risks linked to current customers by examining their most recent
